    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <hr size = "3" noshade>
    <ul>
      <li>I am currently a senior at Rhode Island College studying Computer Information Systems with a minor in Cyber Security. I am a first-generation college student from Nigeria with aspirations of providing innovative technologies and resources to underdeveloped countries in Africa. I am a savvy tech nerd with an undying love for computers (Hardware & Software), blockchain, Computer programs (python, java, solidity, and html). My peers would say I am very loyal, resourceful, confident, and selfless. And my close friends would say I am a fashionista (Thanks to Late Virgil Ablohâ€™s inspiration, I was recently able to launch my own brand "Merka," which stands for "Awesome, Amazing, and Extraordinary"), jovial, silly, and dependable. I am also musically inclined and can play five instruments with Drums being my favorite. I am looking forward to starting my career in IT and working with well experienced tech savvy nerds like myself and to also incorporate my active learning, leadership, communication, innovation, Analytical thinking, complex problem solving and adaptability skills to promote and foster a better work environment for me and my peers. Belonging to me is being somewhere I am accepted, comfortable and able to express my ideas and having a sense of belonging in any work environment would enable me to contribute at my fullest.</li>
